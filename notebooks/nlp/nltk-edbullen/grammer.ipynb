    "# NLTK Grammar Parsing #\n",
    "\n",
    "To go beyond classifying indivdual words in a sentence and summarising counts and frequencies of items, we can consider the grammer structure of sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using formal grammar to describe the structure of Natural Language with its huge amount of structure variation and word-combinations is very challenging with fixed programmatic approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Context Free Grammar (CFG) is one approach for tackling the challenge of defining relationships and heirarchies between words in a sentence.  *\"A context-free grammar provides a simple and mathematically precise mechanism for describing the methods by which phrases in some natural language are built from smaller blocks, capturing the \"block structure\" of sentences in a natural way\"* (Wikepedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar )\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as the core Python NLTK library, there is a widely used package called spaCy, which is written in C and Python: https://spacy.io    Another well known NLP toolkit is the Stanford CoreNLP package. For more advanced use-cases, it is worth exploring some of these other packages as well as NLTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notation and Overview ##\n",
    "Typically the notation convention is to represent Sentences as \"S\".  This can also be a representation of a sub-sentence that can be used to make a bigger sentence - EG, from the Python NLTK Book Chapter 8:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"If we replaced whole sentences with the symbol S, we would see patterns like Andre said S and I think S. These are templates for taking a sentence and constructing a bigger sentence.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Grammars use recursive *productions* of the form S → S and S which build up the meaning of a sentence out of the meanings of its parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical notation for encoding classifications in *Syntactic Categories* is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "S - Sentence  \n",
    "NP - Noun Phrase  \n",
    "VP - Verb Phrase  \n",
    "NN - Singular Noun \n",
    "PP - Prepositional Phrase\n",
    "DT - Determiner  \n",
    "VI - Intransitive Verb  \n",
    "VT - Transitive Verb  \n",
    "IN - Preposition  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## NLTK Grammar CFGs ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CFG` class is used to encode grammars.  Each `CFG` consists of a start symbol and a set of productions.\n",
    "The \"start symbol\" specifies the root node value for parse trees which is usually `S`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to develop a custom grammar that is suitable for a narrow, specific domain of text processing and save it as a text file.  This text file is then loaded using the CFG.fromstring method and can be used for parsing the sentence.\n",
